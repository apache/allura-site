Summary: New docs for Allura's REST API are now published

We have just published new docs for Allura's REST API.  The API is documented as
[RAML files](https://forge-allura.apache.org/p/allura/git/ci/master/tree/Allura/docs/api-rest/) including many examples
and schemas.

[View the API documentation here.](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/forge-allura/#/portals/organizations/86c00a85-31e6-4302-b36d-049ca5d042fd/apis/32370/versions/33732)
