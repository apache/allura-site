Summary: Version 1.3.2 of Allura brings security fixes, new markdown editor, CORS, and more.

Apache Allura 1.3.2 has been released.  It includes 2 security fixes and dozens of small fixes and improvements.  The major
new features are:

* [Updated icons and cleaner project navigation bar.]({filename}/2015-updated-icons.md)
* Enhancements to the [Markdown editor added in 1.3.1]({filename}/2015-markdown-editor.md).  We're talking button
  tooltips, alternate header types, and buttons for section headers, code (works with blocks or inline code), horizontal
  rule, and tables.
* Admin options for any tool available directly in the left sidebar.  No more digging through separate Admin navigation.
* API documented in [.raml](http://raml.org/) files.  We [published the API docs already]({filename}/2015-rest-api-docs.md),
  which are generated from the .raml definition files.
* A site admin (`/nf/admin`) page to permanently delete projects and their data.
