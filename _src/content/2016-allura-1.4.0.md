Slug: allura-1.4.0
Summary: Version 1.4.0 of Allura: updated icons, editor enhancements, admin functionality, and more.

Apache Allura 1.4.0 has been released.  The biggest new feature is the Admin Nav Bar.
It's a complete overhaul of how you customize the tools in your project.
Read our [admin toolbar post]({filename}/2016-admin-toolbar.md) to see how much easier it is to access tool
configurations and add new tools.

Other significant improvements are:

* Config settings to show your custom logo and navigation links in the top header.
* New interface to manage sitewide notifications.  You can specify custom messages to show up on certain pages or page types, or to certain types of users.
* Project exports now can include file attachments from all the tickets, wiki pages, comments, etc.
* Standardized fence blocks in Markdown.  In addition to `~~~` to mark off code blocks, you can use the more common ` ``` `.
It also works to nest code block notation, and specify the formatting language in more ways.  See [CommonMark spec for details](http://spec.commonmark.org/0.25/#fenced-code-blocks).

There are also dozens of small fixes and improvements, see the [changelog](https://forge-allura.apache.org/p/allura/git/ci/rel/1.4.0/~/tree/CHANGES) for details.
